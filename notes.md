# Design Notes
instagram is very straightforward and easy to use it is a website made for everybody all the buttons are very inituative. Personally I like the idea of whatsapp more, because it has just one functionality done better than all of its competitors (in my opinion) but there is no denying that its inituativitly can be learnt from 

Craglist is a website that focuses on its functionality more than on the design part, its a website that is going to be visited so the design part is mostly ignored. Personally i think it could have been done a little bit better so that users can spend less time finding what they want but its deficiult recreating it considering the sheer amount of information it provides. 

github is done almost perfectly in my opinion exceptt that i would love for the ability for github desktop to be launched from the browser.

reddit is fine. And a very good way to find communities its r/ method is very inovative.

PaulGRAHAM completely throws design out of the window and it shows that commitment and consistency could outperform creativity 

supreme is directed toward a very specific set of users and that is shown
